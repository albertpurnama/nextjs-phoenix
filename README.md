# Next-Phoenix

Small example to instrument nextjs llm app. Current issue is I cannot seem to get the telemetry of the openai to Phoenix instance that I have active remotely.

You need to set the .env based on `.env.template`

Once you set those up, then run `yarn dev`

you can make a http call `POST /api/completions`.
